{"date": "2016-06-23", "text": "Today's 4-4 Supreme Court ruling has blocked one of the most unconstitutional actions ever undertaken by a President. The executive amnesty from President Obama wiped away the immigration rules written by Congress, giving work permits and entitlement benefits to people illegally in the country. This split decision also makes clear what is at stake in November. The election, and the Supreme Court appointments that come with it will decide whether or not we have a border and, hence, a country. Clinton has pledged to expand Obama's executive amnesty, hurting poor African-American and Hispanic workers by giving away their jobs and federal resources to illegal immigrant labor \u0412\u2013 while making us all less safe. It is time to protect our country and Make America Safe Again and Great Again for everyone.", "title": "Statement by Donald J. Trump on Executive Amnesty Ruling"}

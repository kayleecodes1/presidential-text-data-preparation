{"date": "2015-11-11", "text": "Hillary Clinton released the following statement Wednesday regarding the results of the election in Burma:\"The Burmese election on Sunday was an important, though imperfect, step forward in the country's long journey toward democracy. It was also an affirmation of the indispensable role the United States can and should play in the world as a champion of peace and progress. \u0412\u00a0When I was Secretary of State, President Obama and I worked with Aung San Suu Kyi and others on the ground in Burma to nurture flickers of progress into a real opening, including the release of more than 1,100 political prisoners, some of whom were on the ballot on Sunday. \u0412\u00a0But we cannot forget that one election does not constitute true democracy \u0412\u2013 that takes a commitment to human rights, strong institutions, and a thriving civil society. \u0412\u00a0And Burma still has a long way to go on everything from national reconciliation to constitutional reform to resolving long-running ethnic conflicts to addressing the plight of the Rohingya people. But the Burmese people have shown once again that they are determined to keep moving forward toward a better future. As President, I will ensure that the United States continues to stand with them and with everyone around the world who seeks liberty and dignity.\"", "title": "Statement from Hillary Clinton on the Burmese Election"}

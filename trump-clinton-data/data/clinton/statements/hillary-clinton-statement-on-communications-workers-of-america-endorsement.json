I was proud to join the CWA on the picket line this year as they stood up to Verizon and fought for a fair deal.\"And I will do everything in my power to defend American jobs and American workers. Any trade deal must meet three tests to earn my support: It must create good American jobs, raise wages, and advance our national security. I do not believe that the Trans-Pacific Partnership meets this high standard. That's why I oppose the TPP \u0412\u2014 and that means before and after the election.\"Above all, we must make sure unions have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House. Because when workers are strong, families are strong\u0412\u2014and when families are strong, America is strong.\"", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on Communications Workers of America Endorsement"}

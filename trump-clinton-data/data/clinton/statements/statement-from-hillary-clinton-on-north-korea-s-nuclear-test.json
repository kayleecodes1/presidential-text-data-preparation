{"date": "2016-09-09", "text": "Hillary Clinton released the following statement\u0412\u00a0Friday\u0412\u00a0on North Korea's nuclear test:\"North Korea's decision to conduct another nuclear test is outrageous and unacceptable. I strongly condemn this reckless action, which \u0412\u2013 coupled with its recent series of missile launches \u0412\u2013 makes clear Pyongyang's determination to develop a deliverable nuclear weapon. This constitutes a direct threat to the United States, and we cannot and will never accept this.I support President Obama's call to both strengthen the sanctions passed earlier this year with the United Nations and to impose additional sanctions. At the same time, we must strengthen defense cooperation with our allies in the region; South Korea and Japan are critical to our missile defense system, which will protect us against a North Korean missile. China plays a critical role, too, and must meaningfully increase pressure on North Korea \u0412\u2013 and we must make sure they do.This is another reminder that America must elect a President who can confront the threats we face with steadiness and strength. We need a Commander-in-Chief committed to a bipartisan foreign policy, who can bring together top experts with deep experience to solve the toughest challenges. And we need a President committed to reducing \u0412\u2013 not increasing \u0412\u2013 the number of nuclear weapons and nuclear states in the world. More countries with nuclear weapons in Northeast Asia would increase the chances of the unthinkable happening. We cannot take that risk.\"", "title": "Statement From Hillary Clinton On North Korea's Nuclear Test"}

{"date": "2016-05-20", "text": "Hillary Clinton released the following statement about the proposed bill in the House of Representatives on the\u0412\u00a0Puerto\u0412\u00a0Rican\u0412\u00a0Debt crisis:\"The House Natural Resources Committee reached an agreement on a bipartisan bill to address the\u0412\u00a0Puerto\u0412\u00a0Rican\u0412\u00a0debt crisis. While I have\u0412\u00a0serious\u0412\u00a0concerns about several provisions in this bill, including the creation of an oversight board that would exert substantial control over\u0412\u00a0Puerto\u0412\u00a0Rico, I believe that we must move forward with this legislation. Otherwise, without any means of addressing this crisis, too many\u0412\u00a0Puerto\u0412\u00a0Ricans\u0412\u00a0will continue to suffer. However, as this bill moves forward, I will work to ensure that concerns about the oversight board are addressed and any such entity includes members that will act in the best interest of\u0412\u00a0Puerto\u0412\u00a0Ricans\u0412\u00a0-- protecting their health, their pensions, and their well-being. We can no longer sit idly by while hedge funds seek to maximize their profits at the island's expense. That's why\u0412\u00a0I will continue to stand with the\u0412\u00a0Puerto\u0412\u00a0Ricans\u0412\u00a0to ensure that they can put their economy back on a path of stability and prosperity, including the steps I am committed to take as President to provide equality in critical federal programs.\"", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on the Proposed House Bill for Puerto Rico"}

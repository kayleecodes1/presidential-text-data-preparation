Clinton now has the endorsement of 26 national labor unions or labor alliances representing more than 13 million employees?:?\"?I am honored to have received the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and their over one million active and retired members?.?Every day, the UAW shows us that we can and we will\u0412\u00a0'Make it in America.'The U.S. auto industry has come roaring back from the great recession and just posted its best year ever\u0412\u2014because the U.S. auto industry has the world's best, hardest-working, most innovative and most creative workforce.We need to keep going\u0412\u2014and we need a President who will always stand with working families. Today, about one in five cars built in North America come from Mexico\u0412\u2014double the share in 2004. That's why autoworkers need more than tough talk on trade. They need a President who knows how to compete and win for American workers. I have said for years that I want to see NAFTA renegotiated to give American workers a level playing field. And we need to take on new challenges, like weak auto\u0412\u00a0'rules of origin'\u0412\u00a0standards that provide a backdoor for Chinese steel and other products into the U.S. We're going to throw the book at China and stop them from cheating American workers.As President, I will stand with the United Auto Workers in protecting workers' fundamental right to organize and bargain collectively, including in their fight to organize the VW plant in Chattanooga. And we need to make sure that the jobs of the future, including in clean energy and clean transportation, are good union jobs that can't be outsourced. If I am fortunate enough to be elected President, organized labor will always have a champion in the White House and a seat at the table\u0412\u2014because when unions are strong, families are strong, and when families are strong, America is strong.?\"?", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on Endorsement by the UAW"}

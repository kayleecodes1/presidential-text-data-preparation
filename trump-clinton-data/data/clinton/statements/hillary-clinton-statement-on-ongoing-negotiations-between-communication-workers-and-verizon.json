{"date": "2016-04-13", "text": "Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the ongoing labor negotiations between Verizon and their communications workers, thousands of whom are based in New York:\"I am disappointed to learn that negotiations have broken down between Verizon and their workers, represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. \u0412\u00a0Verizon should come back to the bargaining table with a fair offer for their workers. \u0412\u00a0To preserve and grow America's middle class, we need to protect good wages and benefits, including retirement security. \u0412\u00a0And we should be doing all we can to keep good-paying jobs with real job security in New York.\"Instead, Verizon wants to outsource more and more jobs. \u0412\u00a0That would mean walking away from workers who have been part of their family and our communities for years \u0412\u2013 the workers who install and repair our phone and cable service, and who respond to customer needs day and night. \u0412\u00a0We rely on these men and women as part of the communications infrastructure that keeps businesses and our economy moving. \u0412\u00a0Verizon should do the right thing and return to negotiations.\"I believe in the power of collective bargaining. \u0412\u00a0If elected President, I will do everything in my power to protect workers, protect unions, and give businesses the incentives and support to keep jobs here. I will also fight for an America where workers do not have to go on strike to have health care, secure jobs and pensions.\"", "title": "Hillary Clinton Statement on Ongoing Negotiations Between Communication Workers and Verizon"}
